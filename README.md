# C-plus-plus_Compiler
C++ compiler using lex and yacc. Includes scanning, parsing, abstract syntax tree generation, intermediate code generation(three address code, quad format), code optimization(constant folding and dead code elimination) and target code generation(ARM). Not perfected yet. Allows if-else statements, for constructs and while constructs.

run exec.bat to creat scanner-parser (a.exe)
feed testing.cpp to a.exe to obtain target code.
enjoy


code isn't perfect.
still gives weird(expected) outputs.
deal.
